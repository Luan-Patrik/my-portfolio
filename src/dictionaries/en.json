      "description": "I would like to introduce me. My name is Luan Patrik, I'm 18 years old and I've been studying web development for about 2 years. I am a motivated young man who is looking for his first professional opportunity. I have a determined spirit and a desire to learn. Although I am still at the beginning of my career, I have a solid knowledge base acquired during my studies in <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>Tailwind</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Next.js</strong> and <strong>APIs</strong>. I have the ability to work in a team and a positive attitude. I am ready to face challenges that arise and adapt quickly to new situations.",
